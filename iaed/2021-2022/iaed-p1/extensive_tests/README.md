## Extensive tests

This directory's purpose is to test efficiency and to aid in the optimization of your code if you are having **Time Limit Exceeded**
errors in Mooshak.

**Time Limit Exceeded** errors can happen as a result of flawed loops, however, in this project, time limit exceeded erros might also 
occur as a result of poor code optimization not directly related to your sorting algorithm's complexity.

If you are having trouble with time limit errors this directory might be useful.

The script provided will generate an extensive test with 20 airports, 15000 flights and the *l* command at the end, 
but you can alter it to your liking, more information in the comments

Some known Time Limit Exceeded errors that have been fixed with better optimization are:
- T30
- T41 
- T42 
- T45
- T46

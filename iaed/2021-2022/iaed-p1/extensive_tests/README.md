## Extensive tests

---

These tests are here to test efficiency and to aid in optimization of your code if you are having **Time Limit Exceeded**
errors in Mooshak.

**Time Limit Exceeded** errors can happen as a result of flawed loops, however, in this project, time limit exceeded erros might also 
occur as a result of poor code optimization unrelated to your sorting algorithm complexity.

If you are having trouble with time limit errors this directory might be useful.

The script provided will generate an extensive test with 20 airports and 15000 flights, 
but you can alter it to your liking, more information in the comments

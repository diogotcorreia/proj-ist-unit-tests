# MML Compiler - Tests

This folder contains tests for the 1st (and only) project (MML Compiler) for Comp 2022/2023.

## Available Tests

There are two kinds of tests: those in the `ok` folder are expected to compile and execute,
and their output should match the corresponding `.out`'s file content.
On the other hand, those in the `nok` folder are expected to not compile at all, which is used
to test if the right assertions are being made by the compiler.
